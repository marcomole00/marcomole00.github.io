Hi!

I'm currently a research assistant at [Politecnico di Milano](polimi.it) under the supervision of [Prof. Gianni Antichi](gianniantichi.github.io).

My research interests are in the field of computer networks, specifically in the design and implementation of network stacks and protocols for high-performance and low-latency applications.

I hold a Master's degree and a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/en/)
