Hi!

I'm currently a research assistant at [Politecnico di Milano](https://polimi.it) under the supervision of [Prof. Gianni Antichi](https://gianniantichi.github.io).

My research interests are in the field of computer networks, specifically in the design and implementation of network stacks and protocols for high-performance and low-latency applications. I am more broadly interested in operating systems, and how they can be optimized for networking workloads.

I hold a Master's degree and a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/en/).

My latest work has been porting XDP/AF_XDP zero copy to the [OpenNIC](https://github.com/Xilinx/open-nic-driver) driver. 


You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/marcomole00), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YdEB6nQAAAAJ&hl=en)and  [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marco-mole/).
